# Neural Network from scratch

In this folder, Neural Network and related methods below are implemented.

- Neural network
    - Input, hidden and output layers
    - Forward and backpropagation
- Activation function
    - Sigmoid, ReLU and Softmax function
- Loss function
    - MSE, CrossEntropy
- Regularisation
    - Dropout / Inverted dropout
    - L2 regulariser(weight decay)
- Optimiser
    - SGD, momentum
    - Learning rate scheduler
- Others
    - Early stopping
    

The purpose of this is to deepen the understanding the mechanism of Neural Network and relating important techniques.
